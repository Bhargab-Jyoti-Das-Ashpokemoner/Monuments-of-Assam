<dl><dt><h2>Overview</h2><dd>
<p>The <stress>Talatal Ghar</stress> or the <stress>Rangpur Palace</stress> is situated in the northern region of Assam and is one of the most impressive of <stress>Tai Ahom architecture.</stress> Not only does it stand as a worthy testament to the vibrant Assamese culture and its rich history, but it is also the largest of all Ahom monuments in the entire world. History buffs and architecture lovers should add Talatal Ghar to their go-to list.<br>
Boasting of a typical Mughal architecture style, the upper ground floor of the Talatal Ghar is popularly known as <stress>Kareng Ghar</stress> and was used by as a live-in palace by the royalty of Assam. Raja Swargdeo Rudra Singha, the successor of SwargadeoRajeswar Singha, added these top floors during his regime making the TalatalGhar an elegant and truly spectacular seven-story royal palace.
An interesting fact about this stunning monument is it has been built with purely organic materials - bricks and organic cement (a mixture of rice powder and duck eggs). <img src="images for html\tg5.jpg" alt="Kareng ghar" class=right>What is truly notable is that this structure has been standing tall and strong for centuries.</p>
<p>Located in Rangpur, capital of the Ahom Kingdom, this magnificent palace was originally built as an army base by the great Ahom Swargadeo Rajeswar Singha between 1751 AD and 1769 AD. In fact, this elegant structure has two tunnels and three underground floors that were built to facilitate emergency evacuation for the King and his army in times of crisis. The alleys are built like a maze, such that even if the enemy entered the premises, they would be completely lost.
Since the Talatal Ghar was primarily built as an army base, it consists two secret tunnels- one linked to Dikhow stream which is around 3 kilometres away and another linked to the Garhgaon fortress, which lies at a distance of 16 kilometres. These were built as hiding chambers and escape routes for the king and his army. Tourists are allowed to visit the upper three levels of Talatal Ghar. The underground floors are closed to visitors.</p>
