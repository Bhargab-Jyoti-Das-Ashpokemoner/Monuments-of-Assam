<dl><dt><h2>Overview</h2>
<dd><p>Let us see another monument, temple in specific which is of great historic significance along with religious importance related to Shiva and that too in Sivasagar.<br>
<stress>Siva dol</stress> is a group of structures comprising three Hindu temples of <stress>Sivadol, Vishnudol</stress> (meaning temple of the Lord Vishnu) and <stress>Devidol</stress>(means temple of the Goddess Devi Durga in the local Assamese language) shrines, and a museum. 
</P><ul><li><h3>Sivadol</H3><p>
This famous Shiva Temple is located on the shores of the Sibsagar Lake and was constructed in 1734. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, Shivadol was built by <stress>Bar Raja Ambika,</stress> queen of <stress>Ahom King Swargadeo Siba Singha.</stress>
It is the tallest Shiva temple in India with a height of about 32 m and base perimeter of 59 m.
Sibsagar, present day Sivasagar, was the capital of Ahom kingdom. The Ahoms had migrated from South China in 1228 and established their first capital at Charaideo 28 kilometres (17 mi) from present day Sivsagar in 1253. Initially they were Buddhists, though Hinduism came to prevail. It was the capital of the Ahom Kingdom till the British Raj was established in India. The tank was constructed between 1731 and 1738 and the temples were built in 1734 by Bar Raja Ambika, queen of Ahom king Swargadeo Siba Singha.</p>
<li><h3>Vishnudol and Devidol</h3><img alt="vishnudol" class=right src="images for html\sv6.jpg">
<p>Sivadol is surrounded by two subsidiary temples Vishnudol (spelt as Bishnudol) and Devidol which are architecturally similar to the larger Shiva temple.Vishnudol is dedicated to the God Vishnu. Devidol, also known as Joidol,  is a Goddess Durga temple. While the Vishnu temple's tower has a honeycomb design with an ornamental criss-cross framework, the Durga temple's tower is designed, in its vertical elevation, with an undulating pattern. Besides these there is a temple of Ram and Hanuman.
