<dl><dt><h2>Overview</h2>
<dd><stress>Urvashi Island</stress> is so called as the belief is that Urvashi, the celestial nymph, used to reside here. It is said that she was called upon to pay obeisance to the <stress>Goddess Kamakhya </stress>for whom she used to take nectar. Therefore, the island, being the abode of <stress>Urvashi,</stress> came to be known as Urvashi Island. Although this unique island is not marked by the remains of a temple, engraved outlines on rocks seem to suggest the ground plan of a temple. The visibility of the island depends on the amount of rainfall. When the Brahmaputra River recedes after the monsoons, the island of Urvashi with its rock-cut sculptures of Hindu deities becomes visible, and remains approachable till the end of spring.
The big concrete Pillar in the middle of the island is not an archaeological piece but was built later. It is just used as an indicator for water level. When the rest of it gets submerged, the pillar remains visible, providing an idea to the boats to avoid the rocks underwater.

<dd>It is located just under the Brahmaputra Ropeway which connects Guwahati to North Guwahati with Umananda Island as the middle point. While it’s inaccessible in the summer and monsoon, we can expect to walk to it during winter and spring as the water recedes and the rocks reappear along with vast sandbanks. We may still have to cross a little bit of water here and there or look for a convenient spot to cross it. Usually, locals at Uzan Bazar put logs at various points to facilitate access to the islands. 
<dt><h2>Best time to visit</h2>
<dd>It is only visible between winter to spring (December to March), that too if it doesn’t rain too much. As the river dries up, the islands become approachable as we can walk along the sandbanks to the island. We can also get an aerial view of the island if we take a ride with the Guwahati Ropeway.
