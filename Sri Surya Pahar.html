<dl><dt><h2>Overview</h2>
<dd>You see the Sun everyday. But have you thought about the Sun God or Worship of the sun? If you are a Hindu then you may be familiar with this. But do you know that there is an entire hill related to the Sun and its worship in Assam. Many people, even a large number of people of Assam are unaware about this. Yes, it is about Sri Surya Pahar.
<br><stress>Sri Surya Pahar</stress> is located about 12 km southeast of <stress>Goalpara</stress>, about 132 km northwest of Guwahati, is a significant but relatively unknown archaeological site in Assam, India. Goalpara is the nearest city from the site. The site is a hilly terrain where several rock-cut Shivalingas, votive stupas and the deities of Hindu, Buddhist and Jain pantheon are scattered in an area of about 1 Km. 
This relatively unknown site near Goalpara in Assam is high on archaeological value. Calling it an Archaeologist's gold mine won't be an overstatement. Surya Pahar translates to 'Hill Of The Sun' inEnglishh. The name implies that the site was associated with the cult of sun worship. The archaeological findings discovered from the area are kept in the local museum. The mystifying site now lies as a ruin and void of any human population, though local vendors and the locals throng the place in the daytime.  The site is centered on the hills of Sri Surya which is profusely filled up with Shiva Lingas. 
People have found 99999 Shiva Lingas were engraved here by Vyasa in order to build up a second Kashi.<img src="images for html\sp6.jpg" alt="Surya Pahar" class=right> A few years ago, some archaeologists unearthed a few Shiva Lingas and a few houses at Sri Surya. These findings confirmed the long-held belief that a thriving civilization held sway around Sri Surya Pahar some centuries ago. There are remains of three major religions here. These are as follows:
<ul><li><h4>Hinduism:</h4>
As the name indicates, 'Surya Pahar', it is associated with some form of Sun Worship. Moreover, as mentioned earlier this hill has thousands of Shiva Lingas. There are also many historical references to this place like the Kalika-Purana.
Besides the numerous stone carvings of Shiva Lingas and the 'Prajapati' slab, there are many rock carvings of the Hindu deities which can be seen at the foothills of Sri Surya Pahar and its adjacent areas. We can also find the sculptural panels of Shiva and vishnu. The twelve-armed Vishnu with a seven-hooded canopy over its head stands prominent. It is worshipped as Dasabhuja Durga.  There is a series of rock carvings on either side of this prominent figure. The notable remains are the Ganesha, Hari Hara, Vishnupadas, etc.
<li><h4>Jainism:</h4>
Jainism could not get any remarkable footing in the North-East region of India throughout its long history. Except for the solitary example existing inside the natural caves at Sri Surya Pahar, hardly any other Jain remains have been found so far in the region. It was probably the followers of Rasbhanath whose foot prints are also at Sri Surya Pahar.
<li><h4>Buddhism:</h4>
On a vast area right from the extreme northwestern slope of the Sri Surya Pahar hill up to one kilometer further south, there are found as many as 25 votive stupas of different shapes and sizes cut out of granite boulders. These stupas are significant for it shows two points: firstly, there was Buddhist influence in ancient Kamarupa. It is in contrast with the commonly held belief that Buddhism was not prevalent in the cultural history of ancient Kamarupa. Secondly, the Buddhist influence in ancient Kamarupa was much earlier than in the rest of the country.</ul>
