<dl><dt><h2>Overview</h2><dd>
Ahoms really gave us many important monuments and historical monuments. The first capital of the Ahoms is also of great historical significance with prominent historical structures.<br>
<stress>Charaideo</stress> was the capital of <stress>the Ahom dynasty</stress> which was built by a person named Sukhapa. It is located at about a distance of 28 kms from Sivasagar. This place is commonly called as ‘Pyramids of Assam.’ It is situated at the foothills of Nagaland. The place contains many burial grounds of the Ahom rulers and their queens which are considered to be very holy. There are about 42 tombs of the kings and queens at the hill top of Charaideo. The architecture of these tombs can be compared with the Egyptian pyramids and reflects the excellent works done by the masons of Assam during the medieval period. The main attraction of this place is its burial vaults which depicts a lot of information about the lifestyle and culture of the Ahom rulers. The main architectural highlight of the tombs is the octagonal dwarf which encloses the entire tomb or maidam. We will be mesmerized by the floral architecture done on the underground vaults and the chambers are all covered with earthen mounds. People travel here from great distances to pay homage to these lost souls who have contributed vital roles in the country’s history. There is a nearby park named the Sukapha Park where there are many amusement options for the children.
