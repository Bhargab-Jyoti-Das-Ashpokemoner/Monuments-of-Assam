Satras are institutional centers associated with the Ekasarana tradition of <stress>Vaishnavism,</stress> largely found in the Indian state of Assam and neighboring regions. These centers, in the minimum, maintain a prayer house, initiate lay people into the Ekasarana tradition and include them as disciples of the Satra from whom taxes and other religious duties are extracted. 
<img src="images for html\st1.jpg" alt="Sankareva" class=right>Sankaradeva is said to have established his first Satra at Bardowa, his birthplace, and then in different places of Assam. The Neo-Vaishnavite satra culture started in the 16th century. They grew rapidly in the 17th century and patronage extended to them by first the Koch kingdom and later the Ahom kingdom was crucial in the spread the Ekasarana religion. Another satra was established by a king named Samudrapal at a place known as Yogihati in the same period (1232 AD) as evident from a stone inscription found in Ambari. Many of the larger Satras house hundreds of celibate and non-celibate bhakats. They not only worship Vishnu and Krishna but also  are wonderful artisans and make masks, musical instruments as well as hand-fans and door frames.
The last quarter of the 16th century saw the satras divide into four different sects.
<ol><li><h3>Brahmasamhati</h3> 
<p>Damodaradeva formed the Brahmasamhati. It represented the brahmanical practices and ritualism. It brought back the caste system to its original form but still adhered to the teachings of namadharma of Sankardev.  Auniati satra, Dakhinpat Satra, Garamur satra and Kurawabahi satra are the most influential satras of this Samhati.</p>
<li><h3>Purusasamhati</h3>
<p>Caturbhuja Thakur, one of the grandson of Sankardev headed the Purusasamhati. This samhati practiced the original features of Sankardev teachings and therefore considered to be the main sect. The head priest was chosen either from a Kayastha or a Brahmin family. Bardowa satra is the most popular satra of this samhati.</p>
<li><h3>Nikasamhati</h3>
<p>The Nikasamhati was established by Mathuradasa and Padma Ata, both of whom were disciples of Madhavdeva. Kamalabari Satra, Barpeta Satra and Madhupur Satra are the three centers of this samhati. </p>
<li><h3>Kalasamhati</h3>
<p>The last of the samhati, the Kalasamhati concerned with the tribal and lowercaste societies, represented the offshoots of six sudra satra and six brahmana satra formed by Gopala Ata and his followers during the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The Mayamara satra and Dihing Satra, the two most important of the sudra satras.</p>
