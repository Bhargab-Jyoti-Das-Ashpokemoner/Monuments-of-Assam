<dl><dt><h2>Overview</h2>
<dd><stress>Ahoms</stress> are literally one of the longest ruling dynasties not only in Assam but in India. This medieval period kingdom gave us many historical locations and obviously a lot of monuments. Let us discuss about the Rang Ghar first. <br>
Often referred to as the <stress>'Colosseum of the East', Rang Ghar</stress> is one of the oldest surviving amphitheatres in Asia. It is located near Rangpur Palace at a distance of 3 km from Sibsagar or Sivasagar town. The name translates to <stress>'House of Entertainment'</stress> and dates back to 1746 A.D. when the Ahoms used to rule present-day Assam.<img alt="Rang Ghar" class=right src="images for html\rg5.jpg"> This monument is an important edifice reflecting the architectural precision and grandeur of that time.
With a height of 10 meters, Rang Ghar is a brilliant specimen of Ahom style of architecture, made exclusively of baked red bricks and hence is of supreme importance to archaeologists and historians. The base of the structure is composed of a series of entrances, and its roof is shaped like an Ahom long royal boat. Sculpted stone crocodiles can also be found adorning the top of the ceiling. The exterior of this grand building has an eclectic melange of exquisitely carved floral and geometrical patterns. 
Originally, the two-storied building was built by Ahom ruler <stress>Swargadeo Pramatta Singha </stress>to be used by Ahom kings and nobles for witnessing sports like buffalo fights and other sports held at the adjoining Rupahi Pathar. It served as a royal sports pavilion, particularly during the Rangauli Bihu festival. Owing to its rich historical importance, Rang Ghar was used as a logo for the 33rd National Games held in Assam in 2007. However, at present, the condition of this monument is quite fragile. Frequent earthquakes and seismic surveys have caused at least 35 noticeable cracks on the walls. Nevertheless, its splendour and magnificence make it worth the visit.
As you walk inside this majestic structure, you will come across arches adorned with captivating sculptures. Rang Ghar has a vast ground, also known as Rupohi Pathar, which is its most striking architectural feature. Earlier, wrestling, cockfights and bullfights were organised here, but it is now a manicured and groomed field which looks irresistible when gazed upon from the top of the building. There is a small flight of stairs inside the hall which will lead you to the top. It was at this place that the dignitaries and royals used to relish the special programmes and events held at Rang Ghar.
A much visited tourism destination in this part of the country, visitors to this structure remain spellbound after witnessing the unique design of the 250-year old monument.
