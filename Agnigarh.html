<dd><img class=right src="images for html\ag2.jpg" alt="Agnigarh">
In the district of <stress>Tezpur, Assam,</stress> there is a hillock on the bank of the River <stress>Brahmaputra</stress> called <stress>Agnigarh hill</stress>. The place is well known for the mythological romance associated with it. According to Hindu mythology, the grandson of Lord Krishna Aniruddha and the daughter of the asura king Banasura, called Usha had fallen in love with each other. Banasura however, did not approve of the match and imprisoned Aniruddha in another place and kept his daughter Usha in seclusion in this place. It was believed that this place had a boundary of fire, which no one could cross without the permission of Banasura, and thus, it was called, Agnigarh or the fort of fire. 
A war ensued between the Hari (Lord Krishna and his followers) and the Hars (Lord Shiva and is followers),  rivers of blood flowed and the city was named Tezpur (City of Blood). Both sides were nearly wiped out and a final battle followed between Lord Shiva   and Lord Krishna, Lord Brahma requested both of them to stop the war by putting him between them. A discussion followed in which Lord Krishna made Lord Shiva see that Banasura was acting wrongly in imprisoning his grandson, and had even disrespected Lord Shiva himself in asking him and his family to be his gate keepers. Lord Shiva agreed, and Banasura was brought. Fearing his life he immediately agreed to the marriage.
At present this is one of the most well known tourist spots in the area. A round stairway takes us to the crest of the hill where we will find the statue of Aniruddha abducting Usha, and the battle which followed, where hundreds and thousands were said to be killed.  There is a platform on the hill from where we will get a birdâ€™s eye view of the city of Tezpur.
