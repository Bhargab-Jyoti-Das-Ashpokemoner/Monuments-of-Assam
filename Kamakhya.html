<ul><h3><li>Kamakhya Temple</h3>
<p>Located on the Nilachal Hill in the western part of Guwahati in Assam,  <stress>Kamakhya Temple</stress> is one of the most revered shrines of Goddess Shakti in India. According to the Hindu scriptures, there are four important Shakti Peethas in the country and Kamakhya Temple is one of them. Kamakhya Temple celebrates the power of the woman to give birth and is regarded as extremely auspicious among the followers of the Tantrik sect of Hinduism. It was built and reconstructed multiple times between the 8th and 17th Centuries and is a spectacle in itself.
The main entrance of the Kamakhya temple is beautifully designed with simple yet elegant carvings that are decorated with colourful flowers. The temple has a massive dome which overlooks the quaint Nilachal Hills in the background. It is especially decked up during the Ambubachi Festival and fare that is held for 3-4 Days in the month of June.
The Kamakhya Temple is one of the oldest temples in the country and hence has a long and illustrious history associated with itself. It is believed that this temple was built during the Mleccha dynasty in 8th - 9th century. The Kamarupa Kings from Indra Pala to Dharma Pala were ardent followers of the Tantrik cult and at that time this temple became an important destination for Tantrikism. The Kalika Purana was composed in the 10th century and it enhanced the importance of the temple as a seat for Tantrik sacrifices and sorcery. Mystic Buddhism or Vajrayana emerged here around that time and a number of Buddhist professors in Tibet were known to belong to Kamakhya. The Kamakhya temple was destroyed during Hussein Sha's invasion of the Kamata kingdom. The ruins remained undiscovered until the 1500s when the founder of the Koch Dynasty Vishwasingha revived the temple as a site of worship. The Kamakhya temple was reconstructed in 1565 during the reign of his son and ever since then, the shrine has been an important religious centre for Hindus across the world.</p>
<p>While the Kamakhya Temple in itself is a highly revered site for all the followers of Hinduism; legend has it that during the month of Ashadh i.e. June according to the Gregorian Calendar, the Bramhaputra River that flows beside the temple turns red. It is believed that this is a divine phenomenon and that it happens because the Goddess menstruates during this time. While some people claim it is due to the high iron and Cinnabar deposits in the water, others continue to believe that it is a divine miracle. Thus, every year during the Ambubachi Mela, the river and the temple attracts thousands of devotees.
