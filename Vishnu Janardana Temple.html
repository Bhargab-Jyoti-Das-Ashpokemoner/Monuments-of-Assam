This ancient temple is located near the Shukleshwar Ghat of the Brahmaputra River, and the lush green landscape around it makes it very beautiful. Lord Buddha is the head god of this temple and considered as an avatar of Lord Vishnu and is worshiped here under the name Janardhana. The history of this ancient temple dates back to the 10th century. It is believed that this temple was renovated in the 17th century by Swargadev Paramatt Singh. A unique combination of Hindu and Buddhism is seen in the distinctive architecture of this temple. The statue of Lord Buddha is installed in the main hall of the temple.

The shrine is a wonderful amalgamation of Buddhist and Hindu architectural styles, incorporating design elements from both of them. The interior walls are milky white with elaborate carvings of deities all over them.

A myth associated to Janardana Temple says that Lord Buddha is believed to be an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. And Lord Vishnu is well-known as Lord Janardana. As per common belief, Lord Janandana once fought and defeated the mighty demon Raja Bali in the disguise of a Vamana to protect the people from the wrath of the asuras.
