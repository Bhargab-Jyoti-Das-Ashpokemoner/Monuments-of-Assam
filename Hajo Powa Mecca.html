<dt><h2>Overview</h2><dd>
Have you heard of <stress>Mecca? Mecca</stress> is the birthplace of the <stress>Prophet Muhammad.</stress> The sanctuary there with the <stress>Ka'ba</stress> is the holiest site in Islam. As such, it is deeply apiritual for Muslims all over the world; it is the heart of Islam.
Now do you know about The <stress>Powa Mecca of Hajo</stress> in the Indian state of Assam?</p>
<p>The Powa Mecca is an important pilgrimage center for the Muslims in this region. It is said that this mosque contains the sacred soil of the original Mecca, and thus is religiously important for the community. On the full moon of the Jaishtha, the Bengali high summer month, the Hindus also visit the shrine and offer their prayer. The word 'Powa' means 1/4th and hence, Powa Mecca figuratively refers to having some of the sanctity of Mecca.  It was constructed by Mir Lutufullah-i-Shiraji in 1657, during the rule of the Mughal <stress>Emperor Shahjahan.</stress> Historically too, the mosque is important. 
Shujauddin was one of the sons of Shahjahan and the inscribed stone renames the Poa Mecca’s location as Shuja’abad in place of Hajo. The inscribed granite is in Persian and translated to English for wider communication by the Archeological Survey of India (ASI).

<img class=cfix src="images for html\pm4.jpg" alt="Hajo Poa Mecca Map">
<dd>Hajo is not too far away from Guwahati, and just a drive of half an hour and so can take you to the city. The closest airport and rail station both are located in the city of Guwahati. There are bus and car services from Guwahati which can take you to the town of Hajo and then Powa Mecca. However, if you wish for a budget trip, consider the rickshaws as they are still the best modes of intercity transport and easily available at the bus stand.
<dt><h2>Best time to visit</h2>
<dd>The temperature of the area is sub tropical with the average range at 24 degree Celsius, and thus, it gets quite hot during the late summer months. However, during the full moon of Jaishtha, people visit the mosque as it is believed to be an auspicious day. It is also better to avoid the monsoon, since incessant rains could disrupt your travel plans (precipitation is at 1928 mm). The best time to visit Powa Mecca is during winter when the temperature is soothing and also the environment seems ethereal.
